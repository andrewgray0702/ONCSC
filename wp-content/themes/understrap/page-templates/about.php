                    <li>Recruit and organize volunteers for administration and visitor support</li>
                    <li>Coordinate volunteer and fundraising activities for cemetery events</li>

                <p>We cannot do these things on our own, so we reach out to others in our local communities and ask their assistance through material donations and/or manpower. Through this effort, we establish strong bonds and open the door for future cooperative endeavors.</p>
