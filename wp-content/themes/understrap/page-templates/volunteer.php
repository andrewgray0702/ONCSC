            <p>Step 1: Contact Kari Bealer at phone number (402) 995-3284 or email kari.bealer@va.gov to setup an appointment to complete a volunteer application and fingerprinting.

you to finish the badge process.</p>
            <p>Step 3: After you are badged please contact Sharon at (402) 991-1836 or tsbissen@cox.net to setup a volunteer training time. Once that process is complete, go online to
